# Project-Cesar-Cipher

This Python program implements the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption technique. It allows users to input a message and a key to encrypt or decrypt the message using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. The program handles both uppercase and lowercase letters, shifting them according to the specified key. Users can choose to continue or exit the program after each encryption or decryption operation. The program provides a user-friendly interface with clear instructions and feedback messages.
